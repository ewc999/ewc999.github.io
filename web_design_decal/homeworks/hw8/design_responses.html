						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>While I new about many of the tatics discussed in the article, I had no idea that it had a name, although this makes a lot of sense because it is such an impactful aspect of websites. Many of these tactics, such as the Disguised Ads are things that I encounter on pretty much all websites I use these days, and are things that end up annoying me quite often. The manipulation matrix at the end of the article was also quite ineresting, as many of these practices can be justified if the advertiser can believe to themselves that the user will end up using their product.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of the article was the discussions about how these practices are bad, but more importantly, how they can be avoided. While as a user, these things are quite annoying and can cause actual financial harm, I sort of understand why they are so prevalent. They clearly do work to get the companies more money and are scientifically backed if not morally correct. I found the suggestion of offering a user something in return in exchange for inputting information the website can use to be quite interesting. I definitely appreciate "free" things, so I would definitely be more inclined to do what the website asks of me in exchange for something. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "I believe that as user experience designers we need to think beyond providing aesthetics and usability to our users. We help shape the lives of people everywhere and our decisions can have significant impacts on the way we as a society behave. Giving in to dark patterns for meeting short-term goals is not the solution." </p>
