						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> 
								Something that I learned from this article was how much decisions that I often overlook impact the user's experience with the website.
								In school, I essentially have been trained to use Times New Roman for most of my text fonts, so it was quite fun and interesting to learn about all of the different
								fonts and how things like contrast and audience go into deciding on a font. I also found it quite interesting to learn about how one can learn
								a lot by just looking at other websites that you find visually appealing, as design is ultimately something you do have to play around with and visualize.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> 
								My favorite part of this article was learning about how to scale font sizes based off of known visually appealing ratios.
								I had never even considered scaling based off of the golden ratio, much less off of something in music like Perfect Fourths.
								I have always been interested in optimizing and explaining decision based off of math, so it was quite interesting to learn
								 about how design decisions can be influenced by mathematical concepts, even if at the end of the day, yours eyes will be the best tool in this process.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "The Modular Scale method uses mathematical precision in order to generate font sizes. 
								However, it's only a guide. Use this method as a starting point and then adjust sizes with your eye." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> I quite enjoyed learning more about how font impacts the design of a website. I would give it an 8. </p>
