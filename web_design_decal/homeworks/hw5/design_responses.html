                                Something I learned from this article was just how in depth animations in websites can get.
                                I had never seen many of the ways these websites and apps used to transition between pages and to queue login sequences.
                                It was also interesting to look at the less "complex" but still very clean and nice looking animations as a contrast to some of the extravagant animations.

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>My favorite part of this article was just getting to look at all of the cool animations. 
                                It was really cool to see all of the creative ways designers were able to incoporate animations in to their app or website's functionality.
                                Especially for mobile apps, it was qute cool to see how intricate the animations for doing things like adding an item to a shopping cart could be.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> 
                                The inspiration that I liked the most was the "Travel Map" by Never-stop. 
                                I found the animation to have cool animations such as the textbox words falling apart, and yet nothing too extravagant that would distract from the overall app experience and practicality. 
                                One thing I also especially liked about this one was that the animation included drawing a path starting from the user's location to their end goal.
                                I thought that this was quite helpful for a travel app since it helps emphasize which direction the user would start from and the general path they need to take to get where they are going.
                                I also liked how the animation kept the searched location on the screen for half a second after searching to help the user know which option they clicked.
