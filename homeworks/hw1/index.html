            Hi I'm Evan, a 3rd year EECS major who originally applied to Berkeley as a Mechanical Engineer, but switched to EECS after finding I enjoyed the CS and EE classes much more than many of my Mech E classes. 
            I'm still trying to figure out which part of CS I enjoy the most, but the classes I've most enjoyed here at Berkeley were probably CS 170 due to it being the class that has made me think the hardest, and EECS 16B because building controls for a car was cool. 
            In my free time, I enjoy speedcubing, going to the gym, and going birdwatching. Lately, I have also started watching K-dramas before falling asleep as a sort of night time routine.

                One thing I learned from this article was how many design decision go in to making a website. 
                I had never really considered how much I could learn about design from just looking through the apps I use on a daily basis.
                For example, I had never considered how many ways there are to display a time-stamp.

                My favorite part of this article was the animations highlighting the different design elements.
                It was interesting to have the hierarchy, something my eyes will process naturally, 
                be explained and broken down.

                "You develop your design eye by thinking as if you were the designer of a product. 
                Open an app you use often and resist the urge to start scrolling through content.
                Instead, I want you to actively focus on the screen in front of you."
