							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> 
								While I had realized that we are most comfortable looking at familiar things, I had never realized how much physical modeling went into computer animations.
								I had never really thought about how in order to make an animation look natural and not funky, one has to make the animation seem like it is following the laws of physics.
								It was also interesting to learn about the general rules for how long an animation should take based off of the size of the object moving, as well as the screen. 
								It was also quite interesting to realize that this rule is different for laptops just because we expect them to move faster.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> 
								My favorite part of this article was learning about how animations should move based off of the webpage scroll and other factors.
								I found it interesting to learn about how only one main animation should really be going at a time, as otherwise it is drawing the user's attention to too many things.
								It was also interesting to learn about how following different curves can make certain elements look a lot more natural in movement.
