						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something that I learned from this article was how much psychology and knowing how the brain works can influence and improve user design.
								While I had mostly thought of the brain and design in terms of visual appeal, I had never really considered how much something like how a brain fills in "missing" info can impact how a user interacts with and views a website.
								It was also quite interesting to learn about how the brain will group certain things together, despite them being far apart, which would be quite helpful for grouping parts of a website.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was learning about how continuation impacts design. I had somewhat experienced the other principles of Gestalt's, but continuation was one that made me the most surprised.
								While looking through examples of it, I didn't realize that it would have even more of an impact on the order of how my eyes perceived objects than color. It was quite cool to realize that the eyes and brain seem to
								always want to track a natural progression and predict the next step, so it makes sense that they would want to contineu with the smoothest flow. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Having an understanding how your brain works will help you become a wiser designer; master manipulator of Visual Communication." </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> Since the article needed to be paid for, I wasn't really able to read this one, but I did read <a href='https://www.toptal.com/designers/ui/gestalt-principles-of-design'>this article </a>about Gestalt's principles. </p>
