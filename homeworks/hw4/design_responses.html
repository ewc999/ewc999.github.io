							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> 
								Something that I learned from this article was how important color accessibility is.
								 As someone who is lucky enough to not have any issues with seeing colors, I had never even known that there were actual laws in place to ensure that websites are accessible to all people, but these laws do seem quite helpful.
								 It also clearly seems like it is in the companies best interests as it not only can reach a wider range of people, but also will look a lot better for everyone if it is more user friendly and readable.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> 
								My favorite part of this article was learning about the different things that companies can do to make a website more user-friendly. 
								It was really cool to learn that some websites have a color-blind friendly toggle that changes the design of things like buttons to allow colorblind people to more easily acces them.
								It was also cool to learn about how there are tools people can use to truly make sure things contrast enough to be user-friendly.
