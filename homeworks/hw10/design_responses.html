							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> I found this article to be interesting to read. While I can pretend like I am able to multi-task by watching a sports game and do my homework at the same time, I know that I am not actually able to focus on both things at the same time. As the article referenced, the more exciting/colorful thing wins out and I often just end up watching whatever is on the tv rather than touching my homework. I think the section about cognitive load with choices was interesting, as it is often referenced that choice is good, but having too much really does feel cognitively overwhelming. This is something I think is very important for design, as having too much going on the page can lead to the user just feeling overwhelmed, or completely missing everything important on the page. I think a good example would be magic tricks, as the performer is able to divert your attention to something else while they perform some other "magical" action. </p>

							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article and why?</p>
							<p> 7, I thought it was an interesting read about how important our attention is, and how we really aren't able to multi-task on two meaningful tasks. </p>
